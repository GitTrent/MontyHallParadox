This project demonstrates the Monty Hall Paradox

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Popular logic states that when pick from the 3 doors, you have a 1 in 3 chance that the prize is behind your door, also there is a 2 in 3 cance that its behind one of the other doors.  Once one empty door is revealed, you still have a 1 in 3 chance that the prize is behind your door, but still 2 in 3 chance that its behind the other door.  

This project models this behavior and shows that will win more often by switching.
